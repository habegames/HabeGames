Hariotica is an open fantasy world, divided into peaceful and combat locations. A beginner will have to get his first equipment in the nearest castle and choose the branch of abilities that best suits his play style. 
Warriors are represented by such classes: Knight, Warrior, Assassin, Archer, Gladiator. Mages are represented by such classes as: Fire Mage, Ice Mage, Necromancer. 
In the process of character development, the player will have to fight with countless hordes of creatures, mercenaries, cultists, skeletons, zombies, genies, elves and many other opponents. Once you have toughened in battle, developed tactics for conducting a turn-based combat, obtained the best equipment and teamed up with other players, you can permanently enter your name on the list of legendary arena players, or challenge the most difficult bosses. 
The game is PvP oriented (especially for massive battles). In a 5v5 battle, you can maximize your role (tank, damage, support). 
A truly impressive number of possessions (140 types of weapons and 350 types of armour) will allow you to compete with other players at all stages of the game. 
Combat system. You shouldn't expect action from the game. The key to victory is the right tactics of warfare, the player's intuition and cold calculation. The more magical abilities the player has, the more varied tactics he will obtain. 
The fight is counted in rounds of 30 seconds each. The player will have to predict in which zone the enemy will cause damage and block it. Up to 2 abilities can be used in each round. If the battle is massive, each round changes the enemy in a circle until one of the teams wins. 
Join the ranks of volunteers, experience many adventures, memorable battles and glory in the new online game Hariotica - The Chronicles of Legend Hero (online RPG).
